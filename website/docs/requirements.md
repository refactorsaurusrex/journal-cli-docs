`journal-cli` works on **Windows, Mac, and Linux** systems. The only _hard_ dependency is the latest version of PowerShell. 

For **Windows users**, this is a no-brainer. If you're using anything _less_ than the latest version of PowerShell, you should upgrade immediately. And while you're at it, make sure you're also using the new [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). It's fantastic!

**Mac and Linux users**, on the other hand, might be reluctant to try a different shell simply to take advantage of `journal-cli`. I get it. This tool may not be for you. However, if you're willing to learn a few new tricks, popping in and out of a PowerShell session to use `journal-cli` may not be as painful as you imagine. Just run `pwsh` to start a session, run your `journal-cli` commands, then `exit` to return to your shell of choice. Easy! Alternatively, you can use another, less cool cli journaling tool. ;)
